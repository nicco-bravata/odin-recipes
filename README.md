# odin-recipes

This is my first project in "The Odin Project" series of online lessons.

In this project, I will be using my knowledge of the command line, HTML, and git to create a simple website with a homepage that links to three seperate recipe pages.

Once completed, this website will be pushed to github where it can be viewed by the public.
