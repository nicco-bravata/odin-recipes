        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A homemade italian dish with a twist: we're gonna use frozen ingredients because we are <strong>lazy</strong> and <strong>hunrgy</strong>.</p>
        <p>My dad used to make this for me all the time as a kid. Hearty, filling, easy to make, and most importantly, <em>CHEAP</em>. This was a staple meal of my childhood.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Frozen Peas</li>
            <li>Microwavable Bacon</li>
            <li>Alredo Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a pot with water and set it on the stovetop to boil.</li>
            <li>Once the water has begun to boil, pour in your spaghetti. Stir in the strands until they bend and allow for the entire stalk to be submerged.</li>
            <li>Boil spaghetti for 10-12 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.</li>
            <li>Once spaghetti has finished cooking, strain out all the water and keep 1 cup of water and set aside</li>

            <li>Grab a plate and set down 2 layers of paper towels. Place 3-5 strips of bacon down on top. Cover with another paper towel and microwave for 40-45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour in your peas and mix together with the spaghetti and alfredo sauce.</li>
            <li>Rip bacon into pieces of desired size and scatter into the pot. Mix to get an even distribution.</li>
