        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sausage and Pepper is a classic italian dish that includes high carb pasta, protein packed sausage, vitamin rich peppers and onions, and a bit of parmesan for flavor.</p>
        <p>It's the perfect dish to get you going for a long day at work or a quick and intense workout at the gym. I eat it often and love it every time!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kielbasa Sausage</li>
            <li>Green Bell Pepper</li>
            <li>White Onion</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Pasta Sauce</li>
            <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a pot with water and set it on the stovetop to boil. Set the oven to 375 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li>Cut the onion and bell pepper into slices of medium thickness.</li>
            <li>Prepare a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil. Place the sausages, onions, and peppers onto the baking sheet, making sure all ingredients are evenly spread out and there are no clumps or piles.</li>
            <li>Once the water has begun to boil, pour in your pasta. Let cook for 9-10 minutes or until cooked all the way through.</li>
            <li>Place the baking sheet on the middle oven rack for 15-20 minutes, or until the sausage has finished cooking and has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li>When pasta has finished cooking, strain out all of the water and keep 1 cup of the pasta water set aside.</li>
            <li>Set the stovetop to simmer, add in your pasta sauce, add in your cup of reserved pasta water, and mix together with your cooked pasta until there is a light simmer in the sauce.</li>
            <li>Once your sausage is finished cooking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Cut the sausage into pieces of desired size and place in a bowl with the onions and peppers.</li>
            <li>Spoon desired amount of pasta and sauce into bowl and mix.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
